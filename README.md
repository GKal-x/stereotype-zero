# Stereotype Zero

Playable first chapter: **Before the Last Train**, a fictional Kato Patisia block.

## Play

On your Android phone, sign into GitHub and open [the Android releases](https://github.com/GKal-x/stereotype-zero/releases). Open the newest preview, expand **Assets**, download `stereotype-zero-0.1.0.apk` and open it to install. No computer or Android Studio is needed. The app requires Android 8.0 or newer; physical-device testing is still pending.

GitHub builds, tests and signs an APK whenever changes are pushed to `main`. Each successful build creates a release with a directly downloadable APK and also keeps a workflow artifact. The repository is private, so sign in with an account that can access it. See [Android installation and build instructions](android/README.md).

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. All scripts, graphics and music are local. Press **Step outside**. Use WASD/arrows to move and Z/Enter to interact, or use the on-screen D-pad and A/B. Tap a marked location to walk there. Sound starts with the Sound button. Start/J opens the journal; Select/P opens the phone.

For a local server, from this directory:

```powershell
node serve.js
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:8765>. The server binds only to localhost. Stop it with Ctrl+C. Direct file access works without a server; browser-local saves may be restricted under file URLs.

## Build portable edition and music sketches

```powershell
node build.js
```

Outputs `dist/stereotype-zero.html`, a single-file edition, and original WAV street/battle sketches. The audio sketches mirror the melody direction; live music additionally uses filtered noise and interaction sounds. The single file can be copied to another computer. Use the Android APK on phones, where browsers may restrict opening HTML from the Files app.

## Check

```powershell
node --test engine.test.js
node --check game.js
node --check audio.js
```

Read [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the character, visual palette, map, dialogue, economy, controls, encounter math, music and scope. Research context remains in [the Athens dossier](research/research-dossier.md).

This prototype uses placeholder prices and fictional people/places. Its browser game is also packaged in an offline Android APK. It lives separately from Waxlog and uses no Waxlog data, credentials or code.
